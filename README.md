[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/cloud-gov/cg-sandbox-bot/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/18F/cg-sandbox-bot)

Monitor Cloud Foundry Cloud Controller users and create a sandbox space for known domains.

The sandbox bot monitors the cloud.gov UAA (User Account and Authentication) server for new accounts.
If a new account is created with an email address at a federal domain name ([using this list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisagov/dotgov-data/main/current-federal.csv)), it will automically create a user space within that
organization in cloud.gov - creating a new organization if one does not already exist.

See also: https://github.com/cloud-gov/cg-sandbox - which purges sandbox resources.

## Creating UAA client

```shell
uaac client add sandbox-bot \
	--name "UAA Sandbox Monitor" \
	--scope "cloud_controller.admin, cloud_controller.read, cloud_controller.write, openid, scim.read" \
	--authorized_grant_types "authorization_code, client_credentials, refresh_token" \
	-s [your-client-secret]
```
